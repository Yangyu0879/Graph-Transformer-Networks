# Graph Transformer Networks
It is the Jupyter Notebbok implementation of [Graph Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06455). 

This code is based on the Pytorch implementation repository of [Graph_Transformer_Networks](https://github.com/seongjunyun/Graph_Transformer_Networks). Becasue of the huge consumption of code on the DBLP and IMDB dataset. It only provides the code running on RAM on the ACM dataset.
